## Project Overview


[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8PQ8BRod/labs-21-dj-helper)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/594af78f1b344d38976c00f9e71cf048?v=d50f07ef5cdc4e61aaadd9b6208e437a)

DJ-helper is a web application designed to help DJ's discover and create a more flavorful playlists for the event they
are performing at. Before an event starts guests will submit music requests. With the help of machine learning the
application will take those requests and create a unique playlist. The DJ can select songs and add them to their set.
The application will also function in real time during the event and adjust to any changes in music trend that occur. 

[Deployed Front End](https://www.dj-helper.com)

### Tech Stack

Python, Dash, spotipy, spotify api

### Predictions

DJ helper uses an unsupervised k-neighbors model to predict audibly similar songs. The model uses spotify's api to
obtain a list of similar artists and then uses the musical features spotify provides to find the closest sounding track. 


### Data Sources


-   [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.9.0/)
-   [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)


### Python Notebooks


[Python Model Notebook](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/feature/Recommendation_Machine_V3.ipynb)

[Python Visual Notebook](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/visuals_canvas/radar%20function.ipynb)

[Python Dash App Notebook](ðŸš«add link to python notebook here)


### How to connect to the data API

1. First you will need to Apply for spotify developer account to obtain API keys
2. replicate this code and your set to go 
    
    client_id = "Your token key" \
    client_secret = "Your token key"
    
    credentials = oauth2.SpotifyClientCredentials(
    client_id=client_id,
    client_secret=client_secret)

    token = credentials.get_access_token()
    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=token)
    sp.trace = False
