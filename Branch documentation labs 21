###Purpose
The purpose of this canvas is to provide visual insight on the models prediction for the DJ. It takes time to listen and 
compare two songs so having a visual would speed things up and give the DJ a quick summary of the feel of the music.

###Future plans
Since data science is working more in depth with the spotify data it makes that we make the visual. However when it
comes to visuals, python has limited packages therefore it is recommended that the web team create a more eye pleasing
visual. What data science created for this release canvas is the most compact and simple to understand representation of
the data. 
  
###Radar Chart
After many iterations the best visual type the team concluded was the radar chart also known as spider charts. 
The final product for this canvas can be found in the file called [radar function.ipynb](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/visuals_canvas/radar%20function.ipynb)
The plot was created using plotly. As of right now all that is needed for the parameters of the function are the spotify uri id's for the searched and 
recomended track the model outputs. 

####Obtaining Spotify Track ID's
The uri can be found from the browser url link of the track or from the desktop
spotify app. Right click on the track, got to share, and select copy spotify uri.

###Brainstorming
All the other files in this branch showcase the thought processcess, trial and error discovered. 
[visuals_og.ipynb](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/visuals_canvas/visuals_og.ipynb) and [visuals.ipynb](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/visuals_canvas/visuals.ipynb) were the first brainstorming sets.

####Iterations
[Radar chart](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-ds/blob/visuals_canvas/Plotly%20radar.ipynb) tired to make radar chart using matplotlib didn't work out 
then we switched to plotly for the final product
